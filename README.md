### There is tremendous value in taking hard to find information, and putting it in an easy to find place. ####

### Momentum is super important. Small wins are great! ####

### How do we keep projects small (scoping)? ###
* Finding a champion for a project is difficult. 
* Learning how to scope a project is important!
* Deadlines are important!
* Non-technical stakeholders can keep things on track.
* Demo’s are helpful to show progress!

 
### What types of solutions might we have for small problems? ###
* A webpage with 2 mailto: links, to email elected officials
* Just showing/linking information is valuable
* A google spreadsheet as DB, webpage hosted on gh-pages
* Budget clock “how many hours to…”
* List of city representatives on twitter, as a means to contact them
* Have a open “help desk” for community members and partners to get technical advice
* You can forgo a database, and just use a google spreadsheet often

### How do we discover small problems to work on? ###
* Engage with local media about small projects (i.e investigative reporting)
* Have a “call for ideas” event!
* Civic ideas speed-dating! - a way to bubble up common ideas
* Complaint ignite-style talks (generate ideas of what you’d like to fix in your city)
* Invite people to present ideas at Demo nights

### How do we get partners to present an idea that is do-able? ###
* One of the roles of leadership is to prep partners for what ideas make sense. 
* Leadership vets ideas
* Learn about partners & what their needs are
* Ask “what’s the problem” not “what is the solution”?

### Ideas: ###
* Civic stories (how do accomplish civic process)
* Countdown clocks to important dates in your city
* A relatable data set with questions associated, for data analysis
* Collect twitter handles of city officials & how to communicate with them
* Static website showing eligibility & process for various applications (i.e SNAP)
* Website that links to services agnostic of city/state/etc
