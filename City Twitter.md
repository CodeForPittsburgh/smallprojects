# How to start a City Twitter List
## Introduction
This is a simple project that should take less than 10 person-hours, depending on the size and digital literacy of your city.
The idea is to provide a simple, clear list of twitter handles associated with your city, from elected officials to departments to councils & authorities.
Citizens should be familiar with their local political entities and have the means to interact with them directly. Twitter is a decent medium for that.
Bonus points for registering a simple URL to direct people to, like "tweetatxyzcity.com"

## Toolchain
Thanks to Github's support of Markdown (and their extension into Github Flavored Markdown), the toolchain is short. You'll need a document editor (notepad, , Google Docs, MarkdownPro, etc), a github account, and the internet (for research). You'll compose a markdown document based on your research, upload it to github, and link people to the nicely rendered version of the page.

## Initial setup
* Gather a small group of people interested in doing this research, each with a computer or phone.
* *Gauge digital literacy - figure out whether you can do this initial data aggregation via Git commits, or if you need a more easy-to-use bridge document, like a collaborative Google Doc. (For this initial commit, using a bridge technology is acceptable. Ongoing maintenance & expansion, though, should be done through Github's issue tracker)
* Divide up the work - maybe one person researches council, one looks for departments, one looks for authorities.
* Compile a single markdown document and format. Use header tags liberally. This is meant to be human readable as well as machine readable.
* Create a new github repository with that document, as well as a readme explaining the project.
* Publicize your new list, and ask the public to collaboratively add more information

## How to find civic Twitter accounts
Cities can be haphazard about this.

One easy rule - people in the same space tend to follow each other on Twitter. You'll find a lot of accounts by looking at who the accounts you've found follow.
Councilpeople follow the rest of council. The Mayor follows her or his authorities. The Department of Public Works follows the utility companies. The Fire Department might not follow too many people, but the Firefighters Union follows *every* fire company in the county. Look for followers, retweets, etc.
You'll end up opening a *lot* of tabs.

## Maintenance 
Star the repository & allow pull requests. Encourage github-hip folks to make direct commits with new or updated information. Be sure to preserve your nice formatting as the document morphs over time.

Encourage non-technical folks to leave new or updated information as comments on an open Issue called something like "Add a civic twitter account", or to open new issues entirely.

## Promotion and Use
This is a fundamental tool, and should be referenced whenever someone mentions the need to "speak directly to your elected officials."

"Hey, you know that there's a big twitter list of all of those handles. Hold on..."

If built right & with consistent formatting, the list can be as useful to a non-profit as it is to a private citizen. Other tools could be built to scrape the list and auto-tweet key messages to a group or subgroup of officials. 

## Final Notes & Project History
This project was first done as a [one-off project](https://github.com/CodeForPittsburgh/citytwitter/blob/master/Twitter%20Handles.md) by Code for Pittsburgh. Months after it was launched, it was used as the starting point for the City's internal social media asset map, a win in our book.
